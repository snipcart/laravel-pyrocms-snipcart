## Errors & Logging

When you start a new PyroCMS project, error and exception handling is already configured for you through Laravel's default provisions.

For logging, Laravel utilizes the [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) library, which provides support for a variety of powerful log handlers. Laravel configures several of these handlers for you, allowing you to choose between a single log file, rotating log files, or writing error information to the system log.
