title: Streams Platform Configuration

### Streams Platform Configuration

The Streams Platform contains it's own configuration. You may easily access configuration values for the Streams Platform just the same as you would any other configuration. Configuration values for the Streams Platform have a `streams::` prefix:

    $value = config('streams::locales.default');

To set configuration values at runtime, pass an array to the `config` helper:

    config(['streams::assets.paths.my_path' => 'my/example/path']);

#### Publishing streams configuration

In order to configure the Streams Platform without modifying core files you will need to publish the Streams Platform with the following command:

     php artisan streams:publish

You can then find the Streams Platform configuration files in `resources/{application}/streams/config`.
