### Bug Reports

To encourage active collaboration, pull requests are strongly encouraged, not just bug reports. "Bug reports" may also be sent in the form of a pull request.

However, if you file a bug report, your issue should contain a title and a clear, detailed description of the issue. You should include as much relevant information as possible and a code sample or link to your repository that demonstrates the issue. The goal of a bug report is to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and develop a fix quickly.

Remember, bug reports are created in the hope that others with the same problem will be able to collaborate with you on solving it. Do not expect that the bug report will automatically see any activity or that others will jump to fix it. Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of fixing the problem you are experiencing.

Please submit _all_ bug reports to the [[http://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms](PyroCMS](https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms](PyroCMS) repository). All pull requests must be submitted to the applicable addon repository.

When submitting bug reports for other addons to the PyroCMS repository please prefix the repository the bug report is for by prefixing it with the application addon.
