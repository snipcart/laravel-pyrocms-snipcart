### Which Branch?

*All **bug fixes should be sent to the latest stable branch. Bug fixes should** never** be sent to the `master` branch unless no develop branch exists for whatever reason.

**Minor** features that are **fully backwards compatible** with the current release may be sent to the latest stable branch.

**Major** new features should always be sent to the `develop` branch, which contains upcoming releases.

If you are unsure if your feature qualifies as a major or minor, please ask `ryanthompson` in the `#general` [PyroCMS Slack channel](https://pyrocms.slack.com/).
