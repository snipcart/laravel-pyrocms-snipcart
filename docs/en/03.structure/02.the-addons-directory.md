title: The Addons Directory

### The Addons Directory

The `addons` directory is where all addons not included in the composer.json file should be kept.

<div class="alert alert-info">**Note:** Typically addons in the addons directory are committed to your project repository.</div>

#### Addon Directory Structure

Just like composer packages PyroCMS addons have a `vendor` slug that is included in their path. Addons also include the site's `application reference` and the addon's `type` in it's full path.

    addons/{application}/{vendor}/{addon}-{type}

An example could be:

    addons/your_site/anomaly/documentation-module

#### Sharing Addons Between Applications

All addons in the `composer.json` file will be available for all applications in your PyroCMS installation.

You can also share addons by placing them in the `addons/shared` folder.

    addons/shared/anomaly/documentation-module
