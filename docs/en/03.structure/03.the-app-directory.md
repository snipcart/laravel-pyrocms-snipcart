### The App Directory

The `app` directory can be used just like in a native Laravel application. While it is recommended to bundle your application logic in addons the app directory can be used all the same.

For more information on using the `app` folder for application services please refer to [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/structure#the-app-directory).
