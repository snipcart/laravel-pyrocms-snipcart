### The Config Directory

The `config` directory, as the name implies, contains all of your application's configuration files. It's a great idea to read through all of these files and familiarize yourself with all of the options available to you.

You will notice a `streams.php` configuration file that can be used to alter the boot process of the Streams Platform, the engine of PyroCMS.

For configuring addons and the Streams Platform further please refer to [#configuration](configuration section).
