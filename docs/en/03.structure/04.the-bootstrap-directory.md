### The Bootstrap Directory

The `bootstrap` directory contains files that bootstrap the framework and configure autoloading. This directory also houses a cache directory which contains framework generated files for performance optimization such as the route and services cache files.

You will notice the `bootstrap/app.php` file also replaces the `console kernel` and `http kernel` with Pyro's own.
