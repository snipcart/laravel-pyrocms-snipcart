title: The Storage Directory

### The Storage Directory

The `storage` directory contains your compiled Twig and Blade templates, file based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework. This directory is segregated into `app`, `framework`, `logs`, and `streams` directories. The `app` directory may be used to store any files generated by your application. The `framework` directory is used to store framework generated files and caches. The `logs` directory contains your application's log files. And finally, the `streams` directory contains your stream generated entry models, addon caches, and private storage (non-public uploads for example).

The `storage/app/public` directory may be used to store user-generated files, such as profile avatars, that should be publicly accessible. You should create a symbolic link at public/storage which points to this directory. You may create the link using the php artisan `storage:link` command.
