### The Public Directory

The `public` directory contains the `index.php` file, which is the entry point for all requests entering your application. This directory also houses your assets such as images, JavaScript, and CSS.

The `Asset` service in the [/documentation/streams-platform](Streams Platform) also uses the public directory to cache images and assets from various themes and addons. Cached assets can be found in the `public/app/{application}/assets` directory.
