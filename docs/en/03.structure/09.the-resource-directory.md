### The Resources Directory

The `resources` directory contains Laravel views as well as raw, un-compiled Laravel assets such as LESS, SASS, or JavaScript. This directory also houses all of your language files.

While you can use the resources directory exactly like you would in a native Laravel application you are encouraged to bundle language files, assets, and views in their respective addons that you are developing for your website or application.

<div class="alert alert-info">**Note:** It is highly encouraged to bundle your resources into their respective addons that you develop.</div>

The `resources` directory will also contain override files for addon config, views, and language files. You will be published to the `resources/{application}/addons` directory then when running the corresponding Artisan commands.
