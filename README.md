Exploring Laravel e-commerce capabilities.

What are the benefits Laravel can bring to your next e-commerce venture & what tools can help you build an online store.

I present my own handcrafted solution. It’s a mix of Laravel-powered PyroCMS & Snipcart resulting in a neat e-commerce app.

Steps:

- Set up a PyroCMS demo site
- Add an e-commerce panel to PyroCMS
- Display Snipcart products on your project's frontend
- Use webhooks & Laravel controllers inside PyroCMS
- Use Snipcart's custom validation during checkout
